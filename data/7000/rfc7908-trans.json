Frequent incidents that result in significant disruptions to Internet routing are labeled route leaks, but to date a common definition of the term has been lacking. This document provides a working definition of route leaks while keeping in mind the real occurrences that have received significant attention. Further, this document attempts to enumerate (though not exhaustively) different types of route leaks based on observed events on the Internet. The aim is to provide a taxonomy that covers several forms of route leaks that have been observed and are of concern to the Internet user community as well as the network operator community.",

It should be noted that leaks of this type are often accidental (i.e., not malicious). The update basically makes a hairpin turn at the offending AS's multihomed AS. The leak often succeeds (i.e., the leaked update is accepted and propagated) because the second ISP prefers customer announcement over peer announcement of the same prefix. Data packets would reach the legitimate destination, albeit via the offending AS, unless they are dropped at the offending AS due to its inability to handle resulting large volumes of traffic.",
